Based on comprehensive analysis of the existing API integration documentation, significant updates are required to align with current implementation state. The documentation at /docs/api_integration.md (472 lines) contains outdated information and is missing critical services that have been implemented.

**Critical Missing Services Requiring Documentation:**

Enhanced Sleep Window Service - DST-aware scheduling system with timezone support, gradual activation with pre-bedtime warnings, and weekend/weekday differentiation. Located at /lib/core/services/sleep/enhanced_sleep_window_service.dart with 25+ comprehensive test cases.

WorkManager Service - Advanced background task scheduling with isolate handling, supporting periodic, one-shot, and deferred task management. Features battery-optimized execution with constraints and cross-reboot persistence via system job scheduler. Implementation at /lib/core/services/background/work_manager_service.dart.

Enhanced Reliability Coordinator - Multi-layer service coordination system with platform-specific background service optimization, health monitoring, and automatic recovery mechanisms. Located at /lib/core/services/background/enhanced_reliability_coordinator.dart.

Service State Manager - Handles state persistence across service restarts, service lifecycle management, and recovery mechanisms. Implementation at /lib/core/services/background/service_state_manager.dart.

**Outdated Information Requiring Updates:**

Dependency versions in documentation do not match current pubspec.yaml implementations. Firebase integration is now optional with graceful fallback mechanisms. Permission handler updated to v12.0.0 with new API patterns. Battery monitoring now includes advanced power management features.

**Architectural Changes to Document:**

Application now uses enhanced sleep window logic instead of basic SleepWindowService. Background services have been significantly enhanced with reliability layers. Service initialization sequence updated for optional Firebase integration. Storage service patterns evolved with enhanced error handling.

**Documentation Scope Expansion:**

Add complete API documentation for 4 major missing services. Update 15+ dependency versions to match current implementation state. Document new configuration patterns for enhanced reliability features. Include current testing frameworks and coverage information reflecting 52+ test cases. Add troubleshooting sections for new service integrations including DST handling, timezone support, and gradual activation features.
