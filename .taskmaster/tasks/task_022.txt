# Task ID: 22
# Title: Resolve ShadcnUI and Tailwind CSS 4 Styling Issues in Rails Backend
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Investigate and fix missing ShadcnUI styling for buttons and components in the Rails backend, ensuring proper installation and configuration with Tailwind CSS 4, and verify all component styles match the official ShadcnUI design system.
# Details:
1. **Audit Installation and Configuration:** Verify that ShadcnUI is correctly installed and that Tailwind CSS 4 is properly integrated with the Rails backend. Ensure the shadcnConfig is included in tailwind.config.js and that all required CSS imports are present in the application stylesheet[2][3]. 2. **Component Styling Review:** Inspect all ShadcnUI components (especially buttons, cards, and form elements) for missing or incorrect styling (rounded corners, shadows, spacing, hover effects). 3. **Utility Class Generation:** Check that Tailwind CSS 4 is generating all necessary ShadcnUI utility classes. Add any missing classes or update the configuration as needed. 4. **Design System Alignment:** Compare each component’s appearance with the official ShadcnUI design system, adjusting styles and configurations to ensure visual consistency. 5. **Documentation and Updates:** Update project documentation to reflect any changes in configuration or component usage. 6. **Code Examples:** If needed, add or update component examples in the codebase to demonstrate correct usage and styling.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Visual Inspection:** Manually review all ShadcnUI components in the Rails backend to ensure they display with proper styling (rounded corners, shadows, spacing, hover effects). 2. **Configuration Validation:** Confirm that Tailwind CSS 4 is generating all required utility classes by inspecting the generated CSS and checking for missing or incorrect class definitions. 3. **Design System Comparison:** Compare each component’s appearance with the official ShadcnUI documentation and design system. 4. **Responsive Testing:** Test components at various screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior. 5. **Regression Testing:** Verify that existing functionality is not broken by styling changes. 6. **Documentation Review:** Ensure all changes are documented and that the team is aware of any new configuration requirements.

# Subtasks:
