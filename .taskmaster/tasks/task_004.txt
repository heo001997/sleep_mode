# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Sleep Session API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop RESTful API endpoints for sleep session data management and synchronization
# Details:
Generate SleepSessionsController with CRUD operations: index (GET /api/sleep_sessions), show (GET /api/sleep_sessions/:id), create (POST /api/sleep_sessions), update (PATCH /api/sleep_sessions/:id), destroy (DELETE /api/sleep_sessions/:id). Implement JSON serialization using ActiveModel::Serializers or Jbuilder. Add pagination using `kaminari` gem (25 records per page). Include filtering by date range and sorting by created_at. Add proper error handling for invalid data, unauthorized access, and not found resources. Implement bulk operations for mobile app sync efficiency.

# Test Strategy:
Test all CRUD operations with authenticated requests, verify pagination works, test date filtering and sorting, ensure proper error responses for edge cases, validate JSON response format.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Generate Controller and Define Routes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the controller file and set up RESTful routes for the resource, following best practices for naming and HTTP method usage.
### Details:
Ensure routes use plural nouns and appropriate HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

## 2. Implement CRUD Actions [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop Create, Read, Update, and Delete actions within the controller to handle resource management.
### Details:
Each action should correspond to its respective HTTP method and route.

## 3. Add Pagination to List Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Integrate pagination logic into list endpoints to efficiently handle large datasets.
### Details:
Use query parameters (e.g., page, limit) to control pagination.

## 4. Implement Filtering and Sorting [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Enable filtering and sorting of resources via query parameters on list endpoints.
### Details:
Support common filters and allow sorting by specified fields.

## 5. Handle Errors and Provide Informative Responses [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Add robust error handling to all endpoints, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and clear error messages.
### Details:
Use try-catch blocks and standardized error payloads for client usability.

## 6. Implement Bulk Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.5
### Description: Add endpoints and logic for bulk create, update, or delete operations on resources.
### Details:
Ensure bulk operations follow RESTful conventions and handle errors gracefully.

## 7. Test All Endpoints and Features [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Write and execute unit and integration tests for all endpoints, including edge cases for pagination, filtering, sorting, error handling, and bulk operations.
### Details:
Ensure comprehensive coverage and validate correct behavior under various scenarios.
