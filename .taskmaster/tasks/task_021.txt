# Title: Fix ShadcnUI Styling in Rails Backend with Tailwind CSS 4
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 17, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Investigate and resolve missing ShadcnUI styling for buttons and components in the Rails backend, ensuring proper installation and configuration with Tailwind CSS 4, and verify that all component styles match the official ShadcnUI design system.
# Details:
1. **Audit Installation and Configuration:** Verify that ShadcnUI is correctly installed and that the Tailwind CSS 4 configuration is properly integrated with the Rails backend. Ensure the shadcnConfig is included in the tailwind.config.js and that all required CSS imports are present in the application stylesheet[2][3]. 2. **Component Styling Review:** Inspect all ShadcnUI components to ensure they have proper rounded corners, shadows, padding, and hover effects. 3. **Button Component Verification:** Confirm that the Button component matches the official ShadcnUI design system, including button variants and responsive design. 4. **Customization and Testing:** Apply any necessary customizations to ensure consistency across the application and test all components for styling integrity.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Visual Inspection:** Manually verify that all components display the expected ShadcnUI styling. 2. **Automated Testing:** Use UI testing tools to ensure that styling remains consistent across different screen sizes and devices. 3. **Code Review:** Conduct a code review to ensure that all configurations and customizations are correctly implemented and documented.
