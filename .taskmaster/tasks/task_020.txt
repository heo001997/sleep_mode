# Title: Ensure ShadcnUI Styling Integrity in Rails Backend with Tailwind CSS 4
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Investigate and resolve missing ShadcnUI styling for buttons and components in the Rails backend, ensuring proper installation and configuration with Tailwind CSS 4, and verify that all component styles match the official ShadcnUI design system.
# Details:
1. **Audit Installation and Configuration:** Verify that ShadcnUI is correctly installed and that the Tailwind CSS 4 configuration is properly integrated with the Rails backend. Check that the shadcnConfig is included in the tailwind.config.js and that all required CSS imports are present in the application stylesheet[2][3].
2. **Component Styling Review:** Inspect all ShadcnUI components (especially buttons) for missing or incorrect styling such as rounded corners, shadows, proper padding, and hover effects. Ensure that each component uses the correct utility classes and CSS variables as defined by ShadcnUI.
3. **Update and Customize:** If necessary, update the Tailwind configuration to include all required ShadcnUI presets and customizations. Add or adjust utility classes and CSS variables to match the official ShadcnUI design system.
4. **Button Component Alignment:** Specifically ensure that the Button component matches the official ShadcnUI design system, including all variants, states, and responsive behavior.
5. **Documentation and Cleanup:** Document any changes made to the configuration or component styling for future reference. Remove any deprecated or redundant styles.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Visual Inspection:** Manually review all ShadcnUI components in the Rails backend UI to confirm that styling (rounded corners, shadows, padding, hover effects) matches the official ShadcnUI design system.
2. **Configuration Check:** Verify that the Tailwind CSS 4 configuration includes all necessary ShadcnUI presets and that the shadcnConfig is correctly merged into the tailwind.config.js.
3. **Component Testing:** Test each ShadcnUI component (especially buttons) in different states (hover, focus, active) and screen sizes to ensure consistent styling and behavior.
4. **Regression Testing:** Ensure that existing functionality is not broken by styling updates.
5. **Documentation Review:** Confirm that all changes are documented and that the configuration is reproducible.
