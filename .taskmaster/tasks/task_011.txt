# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Data Synchronization Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Build bidirectional sync between Flutter app local storage and Rails API for sleep sessions and settings
# Details:
Create SyncService class with methods for uploading local sleep sessions to API and downloading remote data. Implement conflict resolution strategy: server wins for settings, merge strategy for sleep sessions. Add sync status tracking with last_synced timestamps. Create background sync using WorkManager (Android) and background_fetch (iOS). Implement incremental sync to reduce data transfer. Add sync progress indicators and error notifications. Create SyncRepository to manage local and remote data consistency. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed sync operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test sync with network connectivity changes, conflict resolution scenarios, background sync functionality, incremental updates, error recovery, and data consistency validation.
