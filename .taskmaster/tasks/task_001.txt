# Task ID: 1
# Title: Remove Posture Detection Service and Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Remove all posture detection related components from the codebase including PostureDetector service, sensors_plus dependency, and related classes
# Details:
1. Remove PostureDetector service class and related files
2. Remove sensors_plus dependency from pubspec.yaml
3. Remove accelerometer permissions from android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
4. Clean up any imports and references to posture detection in existing files
5. Update dependency injection/service registration to remove posture detector
6. Verify no broken references remain using 'flutter analyze'

# Test Strategy:
Run 'flutter analyze' to ensure no compilation errors. Test app functionality to verify removal doesn't break existing features. Run existing test suite to ensure all tests pass.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify all posture detection files and classes [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Scan the codebase to identify all files, classes, and components related to posture detection functionality
### Details:
Search for files containing posture-related keywords (posture, slouch, neck angle, etc.). Look for sensor implementations, detection algorithms, and UI components that display posture status. Create a comprehensive inventory including file paths and their dependencies.

COMPLETE POSTURE DETECTION INVENTORY

Core Posture Detection Files:

Primary Service:
- lib/core/services/posture_detector.dart - Main PostureDetector class with singleton pattern
  - Contains static methods: isBlockPosture(), isFaceDown() 
  - Implements streams: faceDownStream, blockPostureStream
  - Dependencies: sensors_plus for AccelerometerEvent

Alternative Sensor Service (Vector Math Based):
- lib/core/services/sensors/sensor_service.dart - Advanced sensor service using quaternions
  - Dependencies: sensors_plus, vector_math for Quaternion calculations
  - More sophisticated but appears to be separate system

General Sensor Service:
- lib/core/services/sensor_service.dart - General sensor monitoring service
  - Dependencies: sensors_plus for sensor events
  - Used for activity detection, not specifically posture

Dependencies to Remove:

Package Dependencies:
- sensors_plus: +6.0.0 in pubspec.yaml (line 38)
- vector_math: +2.1.4 in pubspec.yaml (line 46) - Only used for posture quaternion math

Permission Dependencies:
- Android permissions in android/app/proguard-rules.pro (line 20): -keep class com.sensors_plus.** { *; }

Files with PostureDetector References:

Direct Usage:
- lib/main.dart (lines 15, 50-52) - Initializes PostureDetector singleton
- lib/core/services/sleep_controller.dart (lines 13, 45, 61, 118, 505) - Heavy integration
- lib/core/services/dismissal_service.dart (lines 3, 8, 19, 32) - Face-down dismissal logic

UI Components:
- lib/features/overlay/presentation/screens/overlay_screen.dart (line 71) - Status indicator text
- lib/features/settings/presentation/widgets/sensor_settings.dart (lines 3, 5, 11, etc.) - Settings UI for posture detection

Missing/Referenced Files (Don't exist):
- lib/features/posture/data/repositories/posture_repository.dart - Referenced but not found
- lib/features/posture/ directory - Mentioned in memory bank but doesn't exist

Configuration References:
- lib/config/app_config.dart (line 21) - postureSamplingRateMs constant

Documentation Files (for reference only):
- Multiple markdown files in documents/ folder reference posture detection
- README.md mentions posture detection as a key feature
- RELEASE.md includes posture detection in app descriptions

Test Integration:
No specific posture detection test files found, but sleep_controller tests likely cover posture integration.

DISCOVERY: The "advanced posture system" mentioned in memory bank appears to not exist in current codebase. Only the basic PostureDetector service is implemented and integrated.

## 2. Remove posture detection service code [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Delete or comment out all service layer code related to posture detection
### Details:
Based on the inventory from subtask 1, remove service classes that handle posture detection logic. This includes any code that processes sensor data, calculates angles, or determines posture status. Ensure proper handling of any shared utility methods that might be used elsewhere.

- Removed _handlePostureChange() method entirely
- Simplified _considerSleepModeActivation() to time-based only
- Removed PostureDetector.isBlockPosture() call in deactivation logic

lib/core/services/dismissal_service.dart:
- Completely refactored to timer-based dismissal system
- Removed PostureDetector dependency
- Added dismissForDuration() method for 5/10/15 minute dismissals
