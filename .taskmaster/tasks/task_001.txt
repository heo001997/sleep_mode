# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Rails API Backend Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize Rails 8.0.2 application with Ruby 3.3+ for the Sleep Mode web platform backend
# Details:
Create new Rails application using `rails new sleep_mode_rails --api --database=postgresql --skip-test`. Configure Gemfile with essential gems: rails (~> 8.0.2), pg (~> 1.5), puma (~> 6.4), bootsnap (~> 1.18), rack-cors (~> 2.0), bcrypt (~> 3.1.20), jwt (~> 2.8). Setup database configuration for development (SQLite) and production (PostgreSQL). Configure CORS for Flutter app integration. Initialize Git repository and create basic folder structure following Rails conventions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Rails server starts successfully, database connection works, and basic API endpoints respond with proper CORS headers. Test with curl commands to ensure JSON responses.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Rails API Project [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Rails project in API-only mode using the --api flag to generate the appropriate directory structure and configuration for an API backend.
### Details:
Run `rails new <project_name> --api` to set up the Rails API application. This will omit unnecessary middleware and views, and configure generators for API development.

## 2. Configure Gemfile [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Edit the Gemfile to include necessary gems for API development, such as CORS support, database adapters, and any other dependencies required for the project.
### Details:
Add or update gems like 'rack-cors' for CORS, and ensure the correct database adapter (e.g., 'pg' for PostgreSQL) is included. Run `bundle install` after editing.

## 3. Set Up Database Configurations [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Configure database settings for development, test, and production environments in config/database.yml.
### Details:
Edit config/database.yml to specify database names, usernames, passwords, and host information for each environment. Ensure credentials are managed securely.

## 4. Configure CORS [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow frontend applications to communicate with the API backend.
### Details:
Configure the 'rack-cors' gem in config/initializers/cors.rb to specify allowed origins, methods, and headers for API requests.

## 5. Initialize Git and Organize Folder Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize a Git repository and organize the folder structure for maintainability and collaboration.
### Details:
Run `git init`, create a .gitignore file, and set up standard folders for controllers, models, serializers, and services as needed.

## 6. Verify Server and Database Connectivity [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5
### Description: Start the Rails server and test database connectivity to ensure the backend is operational.
### Details:
Run `rails db:create db:migrate` to set up the database, then start the server with `rails s` and verify API endpoints and database access.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

What was accomplished:
- Rails server starts successfully on port 3001 with Ruby 3.4.4
- Database connectivity verified (SQLite development database created)
- CORS configuration tested and working properly for both React frontend and Flutter mobile app
- API endpoints respond with proper JSON format
- All infrastructure components are operational

Key verification tests performed:
1. rails server --port=3001 --daemon - Server started successfully
2. curl -i -H "Origin: http://localhost:5173" -X OPTIONS http://localhost:3001/api/test - CORS headers verified
3. curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:3001/ - JSON responses working
4. Database migrations ran without errors

Infrastructure ready for next phase: Database schema design and model creation.
