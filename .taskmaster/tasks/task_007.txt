# Task ID: 7
# Title: Enhance Native Android Overlay Stability
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Improve the reliability and performance of the FullScreenAlarmActivity system overlay across different Android versions and devices
# Details:
1. Add Android 12+ notification permission handling
2. Implement proper overlay permission checks for Android 6+
3. Add device-specific overlay optimizations for Samsung, Xiaomi, etc.
4. Improve overlay lifecycle management and memory usage
5. Add fallback mechanisms for devices with overlay restrictions
6. Implement proper handling of Do Not Disturb mode interactions

# Test Strategy:
Test overlay functionality across Android 6-14 on multiple device brands. Verify overlay cannot be circumvented through recent apps, home button, etc. Test battery optimization whitelist integration. Verify proper cleanup when app is uninstalled.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research Android Overlay Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Investigate the evolution of overlay mechanisms across Android versions (10, 11, and higher)
### Details:
Document the transition from static RROs using manifest attributes in Android 10 to configuration file-based approaches in Android 11+. Note the changes in overlay immutability and precedence configuration.
<info added on 2025-06-08T14:57:18.078Z>
Research phase completed with comprehensive findings on SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW implementation and security evolution. Key discoveries include confirmation that our sleep mode app's current approach using SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW for full-screen overlay blocking is correct, while RRO (Runtime Resource Overlays) are not applicable to our use case as they serve OEM resource customization purposes. Critical security concerns identified include overlay malware risks, tapjacking vulnerabilities, and fake login screen attacks that have driven Android's increasingly restrictive overlay policies from Android 11 onward. The analysis confirms our existing FullScreenAlarmActivity implementation is properly structured with correct window flags and manifest permissions, providing functional system-wide blocking capabilities. Primary enhancement requirements identified for manufacturer-specific analysis include compatibility adaptations for Samsung, Xiaomi, and other OEM customizations, implementation of security protections against malicious overlay attacks, ensuring cross-version compatibility across Android 10-14, adapting to permission handling evolution, and integrating battery optimization whitelist requirements.

## 2. Analyze Manufacturer-Specific Implementations [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Research how different device manufacturers implement overlay systems
### Details:
Focus on automotive manufacturers' approaches to system bar customization. Document differences in implementation between major Android device manufacturers.
<info added on 2025-06-08T14:58:12.090Z>
Research completed with comprehensive manufacturer analysis revealing critical compatibility challenges. Samsung OneUI Android 13+ implements overlay permission restrictions during phone calls for sideloaded APKs, with Settings.canDrawOverlays() returning false despite granted permissions. Sleep Mode conflicts require clearing Modes & Routines storage data. Xiaomi MIUI demonstrates the most severe limitations with daily automatic permission toggles and aggressive background killing despite all protections enabled. MIUI 14+ requires app pinning, autostart permissions, battery whitelist, and disabled MIUI optimizations. OnePlus OxygenOS exhibits similar severity with settings reverting after firmware updates and enhanced optimization blocking network connections during sleep detection. Cross-manufacturer analysis confirms all major OEMs implement custom battery saving beyond standard Android Doze mode with varying settings paths. Technical implications for sleep mode app include implementing manufacturer-specific permission flows, fallback mechanisms for restricted environments, OEM restriction detection logic, alternative approaches when SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW is blocked, and user guidance for manufacturer-specific settings paths. Findings confirm necessity for robust manufacturer-specific compatibility layer in overlay implementation.

## 4. Implement Android 10 Static RRO Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Configure static Runtime Resource Overlays for Android 10 devices
### Details:
Create AndroidManifest.xml with proper android:isStatic and android:priority attributes. Implement overlay targeting specific packages with appropriate priority levels.
<info added on 2025-06-08T15:03:34.273Z>
CLARIFICATION UPDATE: This subtask was incorrectly focused on Runtime Resource Overlays (RRO). Our sleep mode app uses SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW overlays for full-screen blocking, not RRO for theme customization.

CORRECTED ANDROID 10 IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE:

Android 10 Overlay Permission Enhancements:
- Implement enhanced SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW validation logic
- Add manufacturer-specific handling for Samsung, Xiaomi, and OnePlus Android 10 behaviors
- Handle stricter overlay permission verification requirements

Android 10 Security Compliance:
- Implement background activity restriction handling for overlay display
- Add scoped storage compatibility for overlay-related file operations
- Enhance permission request flow for Android 10 security model

Android 10 Window Management Updates:
- Update window flags and types for Android 10 compatibility
- Implement gesture navigation compatibility for full-screen overlays
- Enhance full-screen immersive mode handling for improved stability

The existing FullScreenAlarmActivity foundation is correct - focus on enhancing Android 10 compatibility rather than implementing RRO configuration files.
