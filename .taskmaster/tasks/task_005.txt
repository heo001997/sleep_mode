# Task ID: 5
# Title: Fix Flutter Analyzer Warnings
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Resolve the 2 minor Flutter analyzer warnings related to unused imports and clean up code quality issues
# Details:
1. Run 'flutter analyze' to identify all warnings
2. Remove unused import statements causing warnings
3. Fix any other code quality issues identified by analyzer
4. Run 'dart fix --apply' to auto-fix common issues
5. Ensure no new warnings introduced during posture detection removal
6. Update import organization following Dart style guide

# Test Strategy:
Run 'flutter analyze' and verify zero warnings/errors. Run 'dart format' to ensure consistent code formatting. Verify app still compiles and runs correctly after cleanup.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify and Document Analyzer Warnings [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run 'flutter analyze' and 'dart analyze' on the project to list all current analyzer warnings. For each warning, record the file path, line number, warning type, and a brief description.
### Details:
Use the terminal or IDE to execute 'flutter analyze' and 'dart analyze'. Review the output and create a list of warnings, specifying the exact file locations (e.g., lib/main.dart:42), code sections, and warning messages.

## 2. Recommend Fixes for Each Warning [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: For each identified warning, determine the recommended fix. Reference automated suggestions from 'dart fix' or IDE quick fixes where available, and document the specific code changes required.
### Details:
Use 'dart fix --dry-run' to preview automated fixes. For each warning, note the recommended change (e.g., replace deprecated API, add required null check) and specify the code section to update.

## 3. Break Down Implementation Steps [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create a sequential list of implementation steps for addressing each warning, including precise file paths and code sections. Ensure steps are clear and actionable for a developer.
### Details:
For each warning, outline the step-by-step process to apply the fix (e.g., open lib/widgets/button.dart, navigate to line 15, replace 'FlatButton' with 'TextButton'). Ensure all steps are ordered and reference the correct files and lines.
