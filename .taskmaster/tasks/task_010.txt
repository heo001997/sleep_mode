# Task ID: 10
# Title: Setup Flutter-Rails API Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement HTTP client and authentication in Flutter app to connect with Rails backend
# Details:
Add http package (^1.1.0) and dio (^5.4.0) for robust HTTP client with interceptors. Create ApiService class with base URL configuration, request/response interceptors, and error handling. Implement AuthService for token management using flutter_secure_storage (^9.2.2). Add ApiClient with methods for authentication (login, register, logout) and sleep session CRUD operations. Implement automatic token refresh logic with retry mechanism. Add network connectivity checking using connectivity_plus (^6.0.5). Create data models matching Rails API response format. Implement offline queue for failed requests with background sync.

# Test Strategy:
Test API calls with valid/invalid tokens, network error handling, offline functionality, token refresh mechanism, and data model serialization/deserialization.
