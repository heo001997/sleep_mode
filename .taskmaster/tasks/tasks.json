Key discoveries include confirmation that our sleep mode app's current approach using SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW for full-screen overlay blocking is correct, while RRO (Runtime Resource Overlays) are not applicable to our use case as they serve OEM resource customization purposes. Critical security concerns identified include overlay malware risks, tapjacking vulnerabilities, and fake login screen attacks that have driven Android's increasingly restrictive overlay policies from Android 11 onward. The analysis confirms our existing FullScreenAlarmActivity implementation is properly structured with correct window flags and manifest permissions, providing functional system-wide blocking capabilities.

Samsung OneUI Android 13+ implements overlay permission restrictions during phone calls for sideloaded APKs, with Settings.canDrawOverlays() returning false despite granted permissions. Sleep Mode conflicts require clearing Modes & Routines storage data. Xiaomi MIUI demonstrates the most severe limitations with daily automatic permission toggles and aggressive background killing despite all protections enabled. MIUI 14+ requires app pinning, autostart permissions, battery whitelist, and disabled MIUI optimizations. OnePlus OxygenOS exhibits similar severity with settings reverting after firmware updates and enhanced optimization blocking network connections during sleep detection. Cross-manufacturer analysis confirms all major OEMs implement custom battery saving beyond standard Android Doze mode with varying settings paths.

Ensure the debounced saving does not interfere with form validation logic.\n4. **Make debounce delay configurable:** Allow the debounce delay to be set per input field if needed, for flexibility.\n5. **Technical considerations:** Consider using Flutter's built-in debouncing features if available, or implement a custom solution. Ensure the debounce utility is well-documented and easy to integrate with existing code.\n6. **Code example (Flutter):**\n```dart\nclass Debouncer {\n  final Duration delay;\n  Timer? _timer;\n\n  Debouncer({this.delay = const Duration(milliseconds: 500)});\n\n  void run(VoidCallback action) {\n    _timer?.cancel();\n    _timer = Timer(delay, action);\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage in widget:\nfinal _debouncer = Debouncer();\n\nTextField(\n  onChanged: (value) {\n    _debouncer.run(() => saveValue(value));\n  },\n)\n```\n7. **Ensure compatibility:** Test that the debounce mechanism works with all relevant input fields and does not break existing validation or save logic[1][2][3].",
