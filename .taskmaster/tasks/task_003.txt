# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement User Authentication System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build secure session-based authentication with JWT tokens for mobile app integration
# Details:
Create AuthenticationController with register, login, logout actions. Implement JWT token generation using `jwt` gem with 24-hour expiration. Add ApplicationController concern for authentication: `authenticate_user!` method, `current_user` helper. Create routes: POST /api/auth/register, POST /api/auth/login, DELETE /api/auth/logout, GET /api/auth/me. Use bcrypt for password hashing. Implement secure session management with HttpOnly cookies for web and JWT tokens for mobile. Add proper error handling for invalid credentials, expired tokens, and validation failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test registration with valid/invalid data, login with correct/incorrect credentials, token expiration handling, logout functionality. Use Postman/curl to verify API responses and token validation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Build Registration Endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop an API endpoint that allows new users to register by providing necessary credentials (e.g., username, email, password). Ensure input validation and prepare for secure password handling.
### Details:
This endpoint should accept user details, validate them, and prepare the data for secure storage, including password hashing.

Registration endpoint has been successfully implemented and is fully functional. The endpoint accepts user details, validates them, and securely stores user data with proper password hashing using bcrypt. All authentication endpoints are now operational including registration, login, user profile retrieval, and logout. JWT token system is working with 24-hour expiration and proper Bearer token format. Security implementation includes bcrypt password hashing and comprehensive JWT token validation with expiration checking.

## 2. Integrate Bcrypt for Password Hashing [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement bcrypt to securely hash user passwords before storing them in the database, and verify passwords during login.
### Details:
Use bcrypt to hash passwords during registration and to compare hashes during login attempts.

## 3. Build Login Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Create an API endpoint for user login that authenticates credentials and issues a JWT upon successful authentication.
### Details:
This endpoint should verify the user's credentials using bcrypt and, if valid, generate a JWT for the session.

## 4. Implement JWT Token Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Set up JWT generation, signing, and validation logic for issuing tokens during login and verifying them on protected routes.
### Details:
Use secure signing keys and include necessary claims (iss, exp, aud, sub, etc.) in the JWT. Ensure proper validation of tokens on each request.

## 5. Add Authentication Helpers [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Develop helper functions or middleware for extracting, validating, and decoding JWTs from incoming requests.
### Details:
Helpers should handle token extraction from headers/cookies, validate signatures and claims, and attach user context to requests.

## 6. Build Logout Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Implement an endpoint or mechanism to handle user logout, such as token invalidation or client-side token removal.
### Details:
For stateless JWT, this may involve instructing the client to delete the token or maintaining a token blacklist if necessary.

## 7. Handle Errors and Test All Flows [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling for all endpoints and thoroughly test registration, login, logout, and token validation flows.
### Details:
Ensure clear error messages for invalid credentials, expired tokens, and other authentication failures. Write tests to cover all authentication scenarios.
