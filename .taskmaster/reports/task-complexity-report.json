      "taskTitle": "Update App Icon to Sleep-Mode Theme",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down this multi-platform app icon update task into specific subtasks covering Android icon generation and configuration, iOS icon creation and setup, Flutter configuration updates, icon optimization processes, platform-specific testing procedures, cross-device validation steps, and store preparation requirements.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate-high complexity due to multiple platform requirements (Android/iOS), various icon formats and sizes needed, configuration file updates, and comprehensive testing across different devices and launchers. While technically straightforward, it requires attention to platform-specific guidelines and thorough validation."

      "taskTitle": "Update API Integration to New 3-Endpoint Structure",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the API integration update into granular subtasks covering: endpoint refactoring for each of the three endpoints, updating HTTP client logic, modifying request/response models, enhancing error handling, refactoring mock services, updating all documentation and integration guides, handling data migration and mapping, and updating configuration and authentication logic. Ensure each subtask is independently testable and clearly scoped.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves significant refactoring across multiple layers of the application, including endpoint logic, data models, error handling, mock services, documentation, and configuration. Each area requires careful coordination to maintain backward compatibility and ensure robust testing. The breadth of changes, need for regression testing, and documentation updates contribute to a high complexity score. Expanding into at least eight subtasks will help manage risk and ensure thorough coverage of all impacted areas."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the task by adding a subtask to audit and document the current state of ShadcnUI component usage and styling in the Rails backend, ensuring all components are mapped and any discrepancies are noted before proceeding with fixes.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical steps (installation audit, Tailwind config, utility class addition, testing), but is well-scoped and already has four subtasks. Adding a documentation/audit subtask will help ensure all components are accounted for and discrepancies are tracked, reducing risk of missing edge cases."

      "reasoning": "This task is broader and more detailed, covering installation, configuration, styling, documentation, and testing. It requires a thorough audit and documentation of current state, plus additional checks for CSS variables, dark mode, responsive design, and regression testing to ensure no existing functionality is broken."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of resolving ShadcnUI and Tailwind CSS 4 styling issues in a Rails backend into clear, actionable subtasks. Include steps for auditing installation/configuration, reviewing component styles, verifying utility class generation, aligning with the design system, updating documentation, and providing code examples.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple layers of complexity: integration of two major frontend frameworks (ShadcnUI and Tailwind CSS 4) within a Rails backend, detailed auditing of configuration files, comprehensive visual and functional review of UI components, and ensuring strict alignment with an external design system. Each step requires specialized knowledge and careful validation, increasing the overall complexity. The task also spans both code and documentation updates, necessitating at least six distinct subtasks to ensure thorough coverage and maintainability."
